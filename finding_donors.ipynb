    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classification), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- Naive Bayes models can be used for text classification. For example personal statements made from people seeking vocational advice can be used as an input to the model that could link the document to an area that is likely to be aligned with the ideals of the autor.\n",
    "- Naive Bayes models perform better than other models when dealing with a high feature space. When there is a bast number of different features associated with the label Naive Bayes is a good option because its implementation is computationally efficient when processing bast amount of features (joint probabilities are just the product of individual probablities).\n",
    "- Naive Bayes models are weak when there exist high dependancy between the features. For example medical signs and symptoms tend to have a causal relationship with one another. Hence a model that assumes independency between the variables might not be the best idea.\n",
    "- Given that in this case we are dealing with +100 features we need a model which performance is somewhat indiferent to high dimensionality. Therefore NB seems like a good idea.\n",

    "- Decision Trees are prone to overfitting. If the minimum split example is to small or the depth too large It will tend to ask too many questions and memorize the data. Because of the nature of the decision boundary (i.e. just vertical or horizontal) DT tend to perform poorly on diagonaly separable data.\n",
    "- The data in this case is somewhat intuitive so we could just eye-ball a few features in which we could split the data and we would probably be close to the truth. For example we could split by number of years studying and gender because we know those two features are highly related to icome. Given this 'intituiveness' of the data the outpuf of a DT could be to some degree be checked for correctness or tuned just by analysing it directly.\n",

Adaboost in particular does this in a more sophisticated way as just 'voting' since it takes into consideration the errors made by previous model before training a new one.\n",
    "- Adaboost is sensible to noise and outliers. Everytime we choose data points to train the new estimator we do so with repetition that means outliers and noisy data-points are considered multiple times.\n",

    "After testing 3 differents algorithms on the data I believe that the best option for us is to use the Decision Tree Classifier. Although its true that the f-score of AdaBoost is the highest, the difference is not big (~4%) and both the training and predicition times of DT are considerably lower. I can only assume that if we were to increase the complexity of AdaBoost and DT in order to improve the metrics the performance time difference would increase considerably (particularly if GridSearch will be used). Also considering that the AdaBoost model is using a DT as base estimator we shouldn't expect a dramatic superiority of this model over the simpler DT that could justify the lower time performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to notice that with this tipe of data interpretability plays an important role. Since DT have a 'human-like' decision process We could analyse the split points of the boundaries and get some insights about income patterns that could help us understand better our future possible donors. This would be harder to acomplish with other classifiers."

    "Our model will basically 'ask' different questions to the data (e.g. 'did the person study for >12 years?' or 'is the person an US-citizen?') this questions separate our possible donors into two groups. Our goal is to ask the questions that get us to two  groups so that the members of one group earn >50K (our target group) and the other <=50K. How does the model knows which questions to ask? it starts randomly and based on the 'usefullness' (i.e. how well the questions discriminate between >50K and <50k earners) it decides which is the best question to ask for a particular feature then it stars evaluating the other features and repeats the same process until we get a set of questions that separate our two different groups. Once the model knows which questions to ask its just a matter of classifing the new persons according to the questions we already know are most likely to be relevant to know the income group to which they belong."

    "Based on a quick overview of the data and intuition I would say occupation, education-num, age, hours-per-week and sex are the most relevant features regarding the income. The exact order in which to rank them without a deeper analisys its not easy to determine. Nevertheless Education occupation and age are likely to be among the top three since salaries are generally are highly dependent on the occupation and possition inside a company and these two are in turn dependent on education and age respectively.  The number of hours per  week could help us divide our data neatly when we consider halftimers or particuarly low values and the distribution of income between men and women is clearly not balanced. For all of these reasons I would make such selection of features."

    "I predicted correctly 3 (age, hours, education) of the five top features although not in the right order. Age is clearly and important features since the chances of earning >50K decreases dramatically with age. Hours per week might not tell us very much when comparing two people that work full time but the information gain would be high if we were to divide between <20hours per week and >20hours. I couldn't guess capital gain as a feature since in my opinion its a lite vague what it means. Marital status makes since we can invest much more time and effort into our professions when we are single. And education is pretty obvious that its intrinsically related to how much a person earns."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
